A prototype implementation of an idea I had for simulating 3D lighting in a 2D top-down game world.

Available at: https://symaxian.github.io/2.5D-lighting-experiment, does not support mobile touch events.

Dev notes:
 - Run "tsc -w" in root folder, requires a global install of TypeScript.
 - Run "ws" in the root folder, requires a global install of "local-web-server".
